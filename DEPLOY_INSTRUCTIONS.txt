🚀 NETLIFY DROP DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

STEP 1: EXTRACT THE ZIP FILE
-----------------------------
Extract "youth-sports-budget-deploy.zip" to a folder on your computer.

STEP 2: GO TO NETLIFY DROP
---------------------------
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop

STEP 3: DRAG AND DROP
----------------------
1. Navigate to the extracted folder
2. Find the "dist" folder inside "youth-sports-budget/frontend/"
3. Drag the ENTIRE "dist" folder onto the Netlify Drop page
4. Wait a few seconds...

STEP 4: YOUR SITE IS LIVE! 🎉
-------------------------------
Netlify will give you a URL like: https://random-name-123.netlify.app

IMPORTANT: BACKEND SETUP
-------------------------
⚠️ The frontend needs a backend to work fully!

Your backend (FastAPI) needs to be deployed separately:
- Railway: https://railway.app (easiest)
- Render: https://render.com
- Fly.io: https://fly.io

After backend is deployed:
1. Get your backend URL
2. In Netlify: Site Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add: VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.com/api/v1
4. Redeploy

✓ netlify.toml - Netlify configuration
✓ README_DEPLOY.md - Detailed deployment guide
